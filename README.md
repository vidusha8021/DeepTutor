## ✨ Key Features

- **Unified Chat Workspace** — Five modes, one thread. **Chat**, **Solve**, **Quiz**, **Research**, and **Visualize** share the same session, knowledge base, attachments, and citations — escalate from a casual question into multi-agent solving, into a quiz, into a full research report, without losing a message. An **Auto** router capability picks the right mode for you when invoked from the CLI / API.
- **Composable Tools** — Tools are decoupled from modes. Built-ins include RAG retrieval, web search, code execution, deep reasoning, brainstorming, paper search, GeoGebra analysis, plus the new `ask_user`, `web_fetch`, `write_note`, `list_notebook`, and `github_query`. MCP servers plug in alongside built-ins.
- **AI Co-Writer** — A split-view multi-document Markdown workspace where AI is a first-class collaborator. Select text and **Rewrite**, **Expand**, or **Shorten** — optionally grounded by your knowledge base or the web. Every draft can be saved straight to a notebook.
- **Book Engine** — Turn your materials into structured, interactive "living books". A multi-agent pipeline designs outlines, retrieves sources from your KB, and compiles rich pages with 13 block types — quizzes, flash cards, timelines, concept graphs, interactive demos (including a **GeoGebra viewer**), and more. Pages are KB-fingerprinted so drift is detectable.
- **Knowledge Bases** — Upload PDFs, Office files (DOCX/XLSX/PPTX), Markdown, and a wide range of text / code files into RAG-ready collections, fully on **LlamaIndex**. Every (re-)index is a tracked version you can roll back, compare, or inspect.
- **Space — Personal Learning Library** — A unified review surface for everything you produce: **Chat History**, **Notebooks**, **Question Bank**, and user-authored **Skills** (teaching personas defined in `SKILL.md`).
- **Three-Layer Memory** — DeepTutor's memory is a pipeline, not a digest. **L1** is an append-only trace of every interaction; **L2** is per-surface curated facts with citations back to L1; **L3** is cross-surface synthesis (profile / recent / scope / preferences). An inspectable workbench at `/memory` plus a **Memory Graph** let you audit *why* DeepTutor knows what it knows.
- **Personal TutorBots** — Not chatbots — autonomous tutors. Each TutorBot lives in its own workspace with its own memory, personality, and skill set. They set reminders, learn new abilities, and evolve as you grow. Powered by [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot).
- **Unified Settings** — Appearance, Status, LLM, Embedding, Search, Capabilities, Memory, MCP servers, and Tools all live behind a single draft / **Apply** workbench. A shared `UsageTracker` surfaces per-call cost across every capability.
- **Agent-Native CLI** — Every capability, knowledge base, session, and TutorBot is one command away. Rich terminal output for humans, structured JSON for AI agents and pipelines. Hand DeepTutor a [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) and your agents can operate it autonomously.
- **Optional Authentication** — Disabled by default for local use. Set `data/user/settings/auth.json` to require login when hosting publicly. Multi-user support with bcrypt-hashed passwords, JWT sessions, a self-service registration page, and a built-in admin dashboard for managing accounts and roles. Optionally back auth and storage with **PocketBase** for OAuth-ready authentication and improved multi-user concurrency — drops in as an optional sidecar with no code changes required.

---

## 🚀 Get Started

DeepTutor now has four parallel installation paths. All of them use the same runtime configuration layout:

- Settings live in `data/user/settings/` under your current workspace, or under `DEEPTUTOR_HOME` / `deeptutor start --home` when you choose one explicitly.
- `model_catalog.json` stores model provider profiles, base URLs, API keys, active models, embedding settings, and search settings.
- `system.json` stores launch ports, public API base, CORS, TLS, and attachment options.
- `auth.json` stores the optional auth toggle and bootstrap credential hash.
- `integrations.json` stores optional sidecars such as PocketBase.
- Project-root `.env` is no longer used as an application configuration file.

For the full local app, the recommended order is **choose a workspace → install → `deeptutor init` → `deeptutor start`**. `deeptutor start` can backfill missing default files as a safety net, but normal first-run setup should go through `deeptutor init` so ports and model settings are explicit before the Web app starts.

### Option 1 — Install DeepTutor

Use this when you want the full local Web app and CLI without cloning the repository.

```bash
mkdir -p my-deeptutor
cd my-deeptutor
pip install -U deeptutor
deeptutor init
deeptutor start
```

> 🧪 **Trying the v1.4.0 beta?** PyPI normalizes `1.4.0-beta` to `1.4.0b0`, so `pip install -U deeptutor` will stay on the latest stable. Opt in to the pre-release with either of:
>
> ```bash
> pip install --pre -U deeptutor      # latest pre-release
> pip install -U deeptutor==1.4.0b0   # pin to v1.4.0-beta exactly
> ```

`deeptutor init` writes configuration under `data/user/settings/` in the directory where you run it. It prompts for:

- Backend port, default `8001`
- Frontend port, default `3782`
- LLM provider binding, base URL, API key, and model name
- Optional embedding provider for Knowledge Base / RAG

After `deeptutor start`, open the frontend URL printed in the terminal. With default ports, that URL is [http://127.0.0.1:3782](http://127.0.0.1:3782). If you changed `frontend_port` during `deeptutor init` or later edited `data/user/settings/system.json`, use that configured port instead.

Keep the `deeptutor start` terminal open. Press `Ctrl+C` in that terminal to stop both backend and frontend.

Notes:

- `deeptutor start` starts the FastAPI backend and the packaged Next.js frontend together.
- The packaged Web app does not require `git clone` or `npm install`, but it still needs a local Node.js 20+ runtime to execute the bundled Next.js standalone server.
- If you deliberately skip `deeptutor init` for a quick trial, the app starts with safe default ports and empty model settings; configure models afterward in **Settings → Models**.

### Option 2 — Install From Source

Use this when you are developing DeepTutor or want to run directly from a checkout.
Use Python 3.11+ and Node.js 22 LTS for the closest match to CI and Docker.

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/DeepTutor.git
cd DeepTutor
```

**2. Create a Python environment**

macOS / Linux with `venv`:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Windows PowerShell with `venv`:

```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Conda / Miniconda:

```bash
conda create -n deeptutor python=3.11
conda activate deeptutor
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

**3. Install the local package and frontend dependencies**

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
cd web
npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
cd ..
```

If you intentionally change frontend dependencies, use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
to refresh `web/package-lock.json`, then commit both `web/package.json` and
`web/package-lock.json`.

**4. Configure and start**

```bash
deeptutor init
deeptutor start
```

Source installs use the local `web/` directory for the frontend and start it with
Next.js dev mode. Keep the `deeptutor start` terminal open while using the app.
They are intentionally developer-friendly and do not write configuration to
`.env`; edit `data/user/settings/*.json` or use the Web Settings page.

If `deeptutor start` reports an existing frontend that is not responding, stop
the PID printed in the message. If no Next.js process is running, remove the
stale lock files and start again:

```bash
rm -f web/.next/dev/lock web/.next/lock
deeptutor start
```

Useful developer extras:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"             # tests/lint tools
pip install -e ".[tutorbot]"        # TutorBot engine + channel SDKs
pip install -e ".[matrix]"          # Matrix channel without E2EE/libolm
pip install -e ".[matrix-e2e]"      # Matrix E2EE; requires libolm
pip install -e ".[math-animator]"   # Manim addon; requires LaTeX/ffmpeg/system libs
```

### Option 3 — Docker

Use this when you want the full Web app in one container. Images are published to GitHub Container Registry:

- `ghcr.io/hkuds/deeptutor:latest` — stable release
- `ghcr.io/hkuds/deeptutor:pre` — pre-release, when available

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/hkuds/deeptutor:latest
docker run --rm --name deeptutor \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3782:3782 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8001:8001 \
  -v deeptutor-data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/hkuds/deeptutor:latest
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:3782](http://127.0.0.1:3782). Config, API keys, logs, workspace files, memory, and knowledge bases are stored in the `deeptutor-data` volume under `/app/data`.

The container creates `/app/data/user/settings/*.json` automatically on first boot. You can configure model providers directly in the Web Settings page without preparing local JSON files manually.

To use different host ports, change the left side of the `-p` mappings. For example, `-p 127.0.0.1:8088:3782` makes the Web UI available at `http://127.0.0.1:8088` while the container still listens on `3782`. If you change the container-side ports in `/app/data/user/settings/system.json`, restart the container and make the right side of each `-p host:container` mapping match the configured container port.

#### Connecting To Ollama Or Other Host Services

Inside a Docker container, `localhost` refers to the container itself, not your host machine. If you run Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM, or another model service on the host, use one of these approaches.

Option A — host gateway, recommended for normal Docker runs:

```bash
docker run --rm --name deeptutor \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3782:3782 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8001:8001 \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -v deeptutor-data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/hkuds/deeptutor:latest
```

Then in **DeepTutor Settings → Models**, set the provider Base URL to `host.docker.internal`:

- Ollama LLM endpoint: `http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1`
- Ollama embedding endpoint: `http://host.docker.internal:11434/api/embed`
- LM Studio: `http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1`
- llama.cpp: `http://host.docker.internal:8080/v1`

On Docker Desktop for macOS/Windows, `host.docker.internal` is usually available even without `--add-host`. On Linux, the `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` flag is the portable way to create that hostname on modern Docker Engine.

Option B — host networking, Linux only:

```bash
docker run --network=host \
  -v deeptutor-data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/hkuds/deeptutor:latest
```

No `-p` mapping is needed in host-network mode. The container shares the host network directly, so open [http://127.0.0.1:3782](http://127.0.0.1:3782) by default, or the `frontend_port` configured in `/app/data/user/settings/system.json`. In this mode, host services can usually be reached with normal localhost URLs such as `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`. Host networking exposes container ports directly on the host and may conflict with existing services.

To run in the background instead, add `-d` and follow logs by name:

```bash
docker run -d --name deeptutor \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3782:3782 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8001:8001 \
  -v deeptutor-data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/hkuds/deeptutor:latest
docker logs -f deeptutor
```

To stop a foreground Docker run, press `Ctrl+C`. If you used the named detached
container above, run `docker stop deeptutor`. Before starting another container
with the same name, remove the stopped one with `docker rm deeptutor`; the
`deeptutor-data` volume keeps your settings and workspace.

### Option 4 — CLI Only

Use this when you do not need the Web UI. The CLI-only package is installed
from a local source checkout instead of PyPI.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/DeepTutor.git
cd DeepTutor

python3 -m venv .venv-cli
source .venv-cli/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ./packaging/deeptutor-cli
deeptutor init --cli
deeptutor chat
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv-cli
.\.venv-cli\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ./packaging/deeptutor-cli
deeptutor init --cli
deeptutor chat
```

`deeptutor init --cli` uses the same `data/user/settings/` layout as the full app, but changes the wizard behavior:

- It skips backend/frontend port prompts because CLI-only usage does not start the Web app.
- It still writes default `system.json`, `auth.json`, `integrations.json`, `model_catalog.json`, `main.yaml`, and `agents.yaml` so the runtime layout is complete.
- It still prompts for the active LLM provider and model.
- It asks whether to configure embeddings, but the default answer is `No`; choose `Yes` if you plan to use `deeptutor kb ...` or RAG tools.

Common CLI commands:

```bash
deeptutor chat
deeptutor chat --capability deep_solve --tool rag --kb my-kb
deeptutor run chat "Explain Fourier transform"
deeptutor run deep_solve "Solve x^2 = 4" --tool rag --kb my-kb
deeptutor kb create my-kb --doc textbook.pdf
deeptutor kb list
deeptutor memory show
deeptutor config show
```

The local `deeptutor-cli` install does not ship Web assets or server dependencies.
Keep the source checkout around because the editable install points to it. If you
later want the Web app, either follow Option 2 in the same checkout, or uninstall
the local CLI package, install the full PyPI package with `pip install -U
deeptutor`, run `deeptutor init` if you want to add Web ports, and then run
`deeptutor start` from the same workspace.

### Configuration Reference

The Web Settings page is the recommended editor, but the files are plain JSON/YAML and can be managed directly:

| File | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `data/user/settings/model_catalog.json` | LLM, embedding, and search provider profiles; API keys; active models |
| `data/user/settings/system.json` | Backend/frontend ports, public API base, CORS, SSL verification, attachment directory |
| `data/user/settings/auth.json` | Optional auth toggle, username, password hash, token/cookie settings |
| `data/user/settings/integrations.json` | Optional PocketBase and sidecar integration settings |
| `data/user/settings/interface.json` | UI language/theme/sidebar preferences |
| `data/user/settings/main.yaml` | Runtime behavior defaults and path injection |
| `data/user/settings/agents.yaml` | Capability/tool temperature and token settings |

Minimal model setup can be done in the browser: open **Settings → Models**, add an LLM profile, set Base URL / API key / model name, and save. Add an embedding profile only if you plan to use Knowledge Base / RAG features.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/figs/deeptutor-architecture.png" alt="DeepTutor Architecture" width="800">
</div>

The v1.4.0-beta refactor reorganises DeepTutor around **five core surfaces** — Chat, Co-Writer, Book, Knowledge, Space — plus a **three-layer Memory** that sits underneath all of them and a unified **Settings** workbench that exposes every knob. Capabilities (Solve / Quiz / Research / Visualize) and tools (RAG, web, code, reason, brainstorm, paper search, `ask_user`, `web_fetch`, `write_note`, `list_notebook`, `github_query`) compose freely on top.

### 💬 Chat — Unified Intelligent Workspace

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/figs/dt-chat.png" alt="Chat Workspace" width="800">
</div>

One thread, five modes, any tool. The capability picker lives in the composer; the same session, knowledge base, attachments, and references travel with you across modes — switch from a casual question into multi-agent solving, into a quiz, into a full research report, without losing context.

| Mode | What it does | Built on |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Chat** | Flexible conversation with any tool; pick from RAG, web search, code execution, deep reasoning, brainstorming, paper search, GeoGebra analysis. | LlamaIndex-backed RAG + tool registry |
| **Solve** | Multi-step plan → investigate → solve → verify, with precise source citations. | Agentic engine (`deep_solve`) |
| **Quiz** | Auto-validated question generation grounded in your KB; spawns a follow-up chat composer per question. | Agentic engine (`deep_question`) |
| **Research** | Decomposes a topic into subtopics, dispatches parallel agents across RAG / web / arXiv, and produces a cited report with iterative append-mode revisions. | Rebuilt `pipeline.py` (~45% smaller, citations + iterative reporting preserved) |
| **Visualize** | Generate SVG diagrams, Chart.js charts, Mermaid graphs, interactive HTML pages, **or** Manim videos / storyboards — the analyzer picks the right `render_type`. | Visualize pipeline (Animator merged in) |

**Auto mode** (CLI / API: `deeptutor run auto …`) is a router capability that analyses intent and delegates to the best-matching mode, then synthesises the final response — useful when you want the system to pick the right tool for you.

**New chat tools** shipped with the refactor: `ask_user` (asks a structured clarifying question mid-turn), `web_fetch` (pulls a specific URL into context), `write_note` / `list_notebook` (saves and lists notebook records from the chat surface), and `github_query` (issue / PR / repo lookups). Tools stay **decoupled from workflows** — every mode lets you opt tools in or out per turn.

A session also carries a **cumulative source inventory** across turns, so citations from earlier RAG / web hits remain reusable later in the same conversation.

### ✍️ Co-Writer — Multi-Document AI Writing Workspace

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/figs/dt-cowriter.png" alt="Co-Writer" width="800">
</div>

Co-Writer is a split-view Markdown workbench (raw editor on the left, live preview on the right) for notes, reports, tutorials, and AI-assisted drafts. Each document lives in its own workspace with autosave, downloadable Markdown, and one-click **Save to Notebook**.

Select any text and choose **Rewrite**, **Expand**, or **Shorten** — every action runs as a tracked agent edit that can optionally pull from a knowledge base or the web. Co-Writer renders standard Markdown / CommonMark / GFM (tables, code, math, flowcharts, sequence diagrams), supports a HTML tag escape hatch (`<sub>`, `<sup>`, `<abbr>`, `<mark>`), and ships a starter template tuned for DeepTutor product docs and learning notes.

### 📖 Book Engine — Interactive "Living Books"

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/figs/dt-book-0.png" alt="Book Library" width="270"><img src="assets/figs/dt-book-1.png" alt="Book Reader" width="270"><img src="assets/figs/dt-book-2.png" alt="Book Animation" width="270">
</div>

Give DeepTutor a topic, point it at your knowledge base, and it produces a structured, interactive book — not a static export, but a living document you can read, quiz yourself on, and discuss in context.

Behind the scenes, a multi-agent pipeline handles the heavy lifting: proposing an outline, retrieving relevant sources from your KB, synthesising a chapter tree, planning each page, and compiling every block. You stay in control — review the proposal, reorder chapters, and chat alongside any page.

Pages are assembled from 13 block types — text, callout, quiz, flash cards, code, figure, deep dive, animation, interactive demo (now including a **GeoGebra viewer**), timeline, concept graph, section, and user note — each rendered with its own interactive component. Book pages are fingerprinted against their source KB; `deeptutor book health` reports drift and `deeptutor book refresh-fingerprints` clears stale pages when sources change.

### 📚 Knowledge Bases — RAG-Ready Document Libraries

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/figs/dt-kb.png" alt="Knowledge Bases" width="800">
</div>

A dedicated workspace for the document collections that power RAG. Each knowledge base has four tabs:

- **Files** — Browse uploaded sources, preview PDFs inline, and see per-file size / status.
- **Add documents** — Drop in PDFs, Office files (DOCX / XLSX / PPTX), Markdown, plain text, and a wide range of code / data file types. Documents are routed through the appropriate extractor automatically.
- **Index versions** — Every (re-)index is a tracked version. Roll back to an earlier index, compare embedding models, or inspect chunking stats without losing the previous build.
- **Settings** — Pick the embedding provider / model, chunking parameters, and reranker for the KB. Defaults are inherited from your global LLM and embedding profiles.

Indexing is built on **LlamaIndex** end-to-end (the previous dual-pipeline split was consolidated in the v1.4 refactor), with retry-safe re-index, embedding-mismatch detection, and resilient handling of corrupt persisted vectors.

### 🌐 Space — Your Personal Learning Library

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/figs/dt-space.png" alt="Space" width="800">
</div>

Space is the **read / review** counterpart to the active surfaces. Where Chat / Co-Writer / Book are where you *produce*, Space is where everything you produce lives, searchable and replayable.

- **Chat History** — Every conversation across every mode, with title-rename, delete, and resume; deleting individual turns is supported on every entry point.
- **Notebooks** — Save outputs from Chat, Research, and Co-Writer into categorised, colour-coded notebooks; each record links back to the originating session and surface.
- **Question Bank** — Every auto-generated quiz question, bookmarkable and @-mention-able in chat to reason over past performance.
- **Skills** — User-authored `SKILL.md` files that define teaching personas (name, description, triggers, body). When active, a skill is injected into the chat system prompt — turning DeepTutor into a Socratic tutor, a research assistant, or any role you design.

### 🧠 Memory — Three-Layer Architecture

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/figs/dt-memory.png" alt="Memory Workbench" width="800">
</div>

DeepTutor's memory is now a **three-layer pipeline** with an inspectable workbench at `/memory`. The two-file v1 `SUMMARY.md` / `PROFILE.md` model is gone; everything is migrated into the new layout on first boot.

| Layer | Role | Storage |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **L1 · Workspace mirror** (LIVE) | Append-only trace of every interaction, per surface, per day. The lossless record of what actually happened. | `trace/<surface>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl` |
| **L2 · Per-surface summaries** (CURATED) | Surface-specific facts extracted by the consolidator. Each fact carries footnote citations back to L1 traces. Supports per-doc **Update / Audit / Dedup** runs. | `L2/<surface>.md` |
| **L3 · Cross-surface knowledge** (SYNTHESIS) | Cross-surface synthesis: your `profile`, `recent` timeline, `scope` of knowledge, and `preferences`. Hedged claims, each backed by L2 evidence. | `L3/<recent\|profile\|scope\|preferences>.md` |

Seven surfaces feed the pipeline: **chat, notebook, quiz, kb, book, tutorbot, cowriter**. The consolidator is LLM-driven and runs asynchronously (`POST /memory/runs/start`) — you can fire it from the workbench, watch L1 → L2 → L3 propagate, and edit any layer by hand.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/figs/dt-memgraph.png" alt="Memory Graph" width="800">
</div>

The **Memory Graph** (`/memory/graph`) renders all three layers at once: L3 synthesis at the centre, L2 facts in the middle ring, L1 traces on the outside, grouped by surface. Hover any node for an inline preview; click to lock the highlight and trace the L3 → L2 → L1 references inward, so you can audit *why* DeepTutor "knows" something about you.

### ⚙️ Settings — Unified Control Center

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/figs/dt-settings.png" alt="Settings" width="800">
</div>

The settings surface was unified in v1.4 and split by concern, with a draft / **Apply** model so changes are atomic and can be reverted before save:

- **Appearance** — UI language and theme (Cream, Snow, Dark, Glass).
- **Status** — Live health probe across LLM, embedding, search, and storage backends.
- **LLM**, **Embedding**, **Search** — Provider catalog, base URLs, API keys, and active model selection. Active models are picked from the catalog so every surface stays in sync.
- **Capabilities** — Per-capability tunables (chunking, LLM budget, dedup and reference policies, max iterations) for Chat, Solve, Quiz, Research, Visualize, and Co-Writer. Backed by a unified `emit_capability_result` envelope and a shared `UsageTracker` that surfaces per-call cost.
- **Memory** — Toggle consolidator runs, configure cadence and budget, and jump into the memory workbench.
- **MCP servers** — Register external Model Context Protocol servers; their tools are surfaced alongside built-in tools.
- **Tools** — Inspect every built-in tool, its parameters, status (enabled / coming-soon), and i18n status copy.

A "Tour" launcher walks new users through the page, and every capability ships a canonical `capabilities/prompts/{en,zh}/<name>.yaml` so status messages stay consistent in both English and 中文.

### 🦞 TutorBot — Persistent, Autonomous AI Tutors

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/figs/tutorbot-architecture.png" alt="TutorBot Architecture" width="800">
</div>

TutorBot is not a chatbot — it is a **persistent, multi-instance agent** built on [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot). Each TutorBot runs its own agent loop with independent workspace, memory, and personality. Create a Socratic math tutor, a patient writing coach, and a rigorous research advisor — all running simultaneously, each evolving with you.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/figs/dt-tutorbot.png" alt="TutorBot Agents" width="800">
</div>

- **Soul Templates** — Define your tutor's personality, tone, and teaching philosophy through editable Soul files. Choose from built-in archetypes (Socratic, encouraging, rigorous) or craft your own — the soul shapes every response.
- **Independent Workspace** — Each bot has its own directory with separate memory, sessions, skills, and configuration — fully isolated yet able to access DeepTutor's shared knowledge layer.
- **Proactive Heartbeat** — Bots don't just respond — they initiate. The built-in Heartbeat system enables recurring study check-ins, review reminders, and scheduled tasks. Your tutor shows up even when you don't.
- **Full Tool Access** — Every bot reaches into DeepTutor's complete toolkit: RAG retrieval, code execution, web search, academic paper search, deep reasoning, and brainstorming.
- **Skill Learning** — Teach your bot new abilities by adding skill files to its workspace. As your needs evolve, so does your tutor's capability.
- **Multi-Channel Presence** — Connect bots to Telegram, Discord, Slack, Feishu, WeChat Work, DingTalk, Matrix, QQ, WhatsApp, Email, and more. Your tutor meets you wherever you are.
- **Team & Sub-Agents** — Spawn background sub-agents or orchestrate multi-agent teams within a single bot for complex, long-running tasks.

```bash
deeptutor bot create math-tutor --persona "Socratic math teacher who uses probing questions"
deeptutor bot create writing-coach --persona "Patient, detail-oriented writing mentor"
deeptutor bot list                  # See all your active tutors
```

### ⌨️ DeepTutor CLI — Agent-Native Interface

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/figs/cli-architecture.png" alt="DeepTutor CLI Architecture" width="800">
</div>

DeepTutor is fully CLI-native. Every capability, knowledge base, session, memory, and TutorBot is one command away — no browser required. The CLI serves both humans (with rich terminal rendering) and AI agents (with structured JSON output).

Hand the [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) at the project root to any tool-using agent ([nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot), or any LLM with tool access), and it can configure and operate DeepTutor autonomously.

**One-shot execution** — Run any capability directly from the terminal:

```bash
deeptutor run chat "Explain the Fourier transform" -t rag --kb textbook
deeptutor run deep_solve "Prove that √2 is irrational" -t reason
deeptutor run deep_question "Linear algebra" --config num_questions=5
deeptutor run deep_research "Attention mechanisms in transformers"
deeptutor run visualize "Draw the architecture of a transformer"
```

**Interactive REPL** — A persistent chat session with live mode switching:

```bash
deeptutor chat --capability deep_solve --kb my-kb
# Inside the REPL: /cap, /tool, /kb, /history, /notebook, /config to switch on the fly
```

**Knowledge base lifecycle** — Build, query, and manage RAG-ready collections entirely from the terminal:

```bash
deeptutor kb create my-kb --doc textbook.pdf       # Create from document
deeptutor kb add my-kb --docs-dir ./papers/         # Add a folder of papers
deeptutor kb search my-kb "gradient descent"        # Search directly
deeptutor kb set-default my-kb                      # Set as default for all commands
```

**Dual output mode** — Rich rendering for humans, structured JSON for pipelines:

```bash
deeptutor run chat "Summarize chapter 3" -f rich    # Colored, formatted output
deeptutor run chat "Summarize chapter 3" -f json    # Line-delimited JSON events
```

**Session continuity** — Resume any conversation right where you left off:

```bash
deeptutor session list                              # List all sessions
deeptutor session open <id>                         # Resume in REPL

### 👥 Multi-User — Shared Deployments with Per-User Workspaces

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/figs/dt-multi-user.png" alt="Multi-User" width="800">
</div>

Flip on authentication and DeepTutor turns into a multi-tenant deployment with **per-user isolated workspaces** and **admin-curated resources**. The first person to register becomes the admin and configures models, API keys, and knowledge bases on behalf of everyone else. Subsequent accounts are created by the admin (invite-only), each gets their own scoped chat history / memory / notebooks / knowledge bases, and they only see the LLMs, KBs, and skills the admin assigned to them.

**Quick start (5 steps):**

```bash
# 1. Enable auth in data/user/settings/auth.json:
#    {"enabled": true, "token_expire_hours": 24, "cookie_secure": false}

# 2. Restart the web stack.
deeptutor start

# 3. Open http://localhost:3782/register and create the first account.
#    The first registration is the only public one; that user becomes admin
#    and the /register endpoint is closed automatically afterward.

# 4. As admin, navigate to /admin/users → "Add user" to provision teammates.

# 5. For each user, click the slider icon → assign LLM profiles, knowledge
#    bases, and skills. Save. The user can now sign in and start working.
```

**What the admin sees:**

- **Full Settings page** at `/settings` — manage LLM / embedding / search providers, API keys, model catalogs, and runtime "Apply".
- **User management** at `/admin/users` — create, promote, demote, and delete accounts. The public `/register` endpoint is automatically closed once the first admin exists; further accounts go through `POST /api/v1/auth/users` (admin-only).
- **Grant editor** — for each non-admin user, pick the model profiles, knowledge bases, and skills they may use. Grants carry **logical IDs only**; API keys never cross the grant boundary.
- **Audit trail** — every grant change and assigned-resource access is appended to `multi-user/_system/audit/usage.jsonl`.

**What ordinary users get:**

- **Isolated workspace** under `multi-user/<uid>/` — their own chat history (`chat_history.db`), memory (`SUMMARY.md` / `PROFILE.md`), notebooks, and personal knowledge bases. Nothing is shared by default.
- **Read-only access** to admin-assigned knowledge bases and skills, surfaced inline next to their own resources with an "Assigned by admin" badge.
- **Redacted Settings page** — only theme, language, and a summary of granted models. API keys, base URLs, and provider endpoints are never returned for non-admin requests.
- **Scoped LLM** — chat turns are routed through the admin-assigned model. If no LLM is granted, the turn is rejected up-front (no silent fallback to the admin's keys).

**Workspace layout:**

```
multi-user/
├── _system/
│   ├── auth/users.json          # Hashed credentials, roles
│   ├── auth/auth_secret         # JWT signing secret (auto-generated)
│   ├── grants/<uid>.json        # Per-user resource grants (admin-managed)
│   └── audit/usage.jsonl        # Audit trail
└── <uid>/
    ├── user/
    │   ├── chat_history.db
    │   ├── settings/interface.json
    │   └── workspace/{chat,co-writer,book,...}
    ├── memory/{SUMMARY.md,PROFILE.md}
    └── knowledge_bases/...
```

**Configuration reference:**

| Setting | Required | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `data/user/settings/auth.json: enabled` | Yes | Set to `true` to enable multi-user auth. Default `false` (single-user mode — admin paths everywhere). |
| `multi-user/_system/auth/auth_secret` | Recommended | JWT signing secret. Auto-generated on first authenticated boot if missing. |
| `data/user/settings/auth.json: token_expire_hours` | No | JWT lifetime; defaults to `24`. |
| `data/user/settings/auth.json: username/password_hash` | No | Optional headless single-user bootstrap credential. Leave blank when using browser registration. |
| `data/user/settings/system.json` | No | `deeptutor start` derives frontend auth flags and API base from runtime settings. |

> ⚠️ **PocketBase mode (`integrations.pocketbase_url` set) is single-user only.** The default PocketBase schema has no `role` field on `users` (every login resolves to `role=user`, no admin can be created), and `sessions` / `messages` / `turns` queries are not filtered by `user_id`. Multi-user deployments must keep `integrations.pocketbase_url` blank and use the default JSON/SQLite backend.

> ⚠️ **Single-process recommendation.** The first-user-becomes-admin promotion is protected by an in-process `threading.Lock`. Multi-worker deployments should provision the first admin offline (start with `auth.json.enabled=false`, register the admin via the bootstrap flow, then set `auth.json.enabled=true`) or back the user store with an external system.
